# Mouldy-Melons
# Rotten Tomatos, but home-grown

Mouldy Melons is a user-powered film review application, created with an eye towards letting the people share their opinions on films, and ignoring the input of *"professional critics"*.
Ever have a movie that you absolutely love, and wish more people appreciated despite a few bad reviews? MM is your answer!
